# Dynamic simple app

Here we go! Our first challenge for you.
I know many of you (especially you AI colleagues, that dreamed about trying out some new algorithms) will roll your eyes at "We have to do frontend :("
But this will be what we call our backbone, on which we will be able to build smart apps. So maybe first cycle or two you will be left a bit on the side. But not to worry, we will soon be in your field of knowledge.

## Scope

Deliver solution similar to [grandstack-movie recommender](https://github.com/grand-stack/grand-stack-movies-workshop). But the catch is, try to do it so the frontend is dynamically defined in and read from database. 
Minimal result could be only same result as movie recommender on github, but more dynamic solutions will get better evaluation points.

You are not fixed to react, apollo and there is no need to focus on UX as such. Your focus should lie on doing dynamic app (dynamic frontend, and backend(schema)) and beutiful, easy to read and understand code. SO work on documenting everthing so others will be able to learn from you.

## Deliverable

Your app should be up and running and your code published untill 7th of February 2019 at 17:00. All solutions posted after that are not considered for reward. We will have demos and peer review on 28th of February 2019 at 17:00, so please send someone from your team on this event or inform us of possible participation online. You will need to explain your code if necesarry and evaluate others.

Your solution should be seen on: <teamName>.<solution1>.k8.si.
