# Let's try to build our personal AI apps ** EXPERIMENT **

Welcome to **h3k.si** bounty page!

We are a group of developers and AI enthusiasts that want to co create and build a better AI future for ourselves and others! We believe AI should be public and open source and we want to co-create building it, not waiting for corporations to develop their corporate "free" solutions.

We want to begin by building personal analytics and AI tools to improve quality of living that everyone can benefit from, while implementing the vision of building applications, components, and algorithms that have a higher specter of reusability.
Through this process of developing code ourselves, we are building a dynamic structure that can fit a wide array of problems with the final goal of developing a self-learning application.

## We believe that graph is the future of AI and self-learning applications.

We propose starting with basic stack, that covers database, server(API) and client for displaying our results. => [Grandstack](https://grandstack.io/)
This stack like other proposed solutions are our beginning point and should not be seen as dogmas, we are open to changing them if through our iterations, we find a better basic approach.

That being said, your solutions for the exercises are not required to be built solely on neo4j, graphql, apollo and react.
What we want to emphasize, is the basic principle of graphs everywhere! With that in mind, you will of course need to use graph database of some sort, with our suggested being [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/).

## Use existing solutions (open source) and build on them.
We encourage you to use existing solutions (opensource) where you see fit, and build and expand on them. That being said, make sure the code is really open source, with the developer that posts its code has to guarantee that what he has published is really open source and therefore eligible to incorporate in next iterations of the projects. This allows us to avoid legal issues in the future.

## Have fun and learn from others
Although we call the events bounties, the aim is to bring together a community of developers that want to learn from one another while having fun and making some money in the proccess. We will cover many different aspects of the entire development cycle and in order to do so effectively, we won't stick to AI solutions only.

We believe that in order to develop truly AI driven applications, the application itself needs to have backbone that accommodates thas. This is why a good architectural design of bottomline app is essential in building self evolving solutions.

By doing the entire development cycle ourselves, there will be plenty to knowledge to be exchanged between participants. AI developers will be able to learn from frontend/backend javascript ninjas and a bit later those same individuals will be able to broaden their knowledge of AI algorithms. Once we are through with an entire cycle, the community will have a group of well rounded, end-boss level developers :).

## Challenge structure
Our challenges will be constructed on bi-weekly (later hopefully weekly) cycle.
Every two weeks, goal of the cycle will be posted as new folder on this repository, where you will find all the required details  for participation in the event as well as due dates for deliverables.

Bounty eligible solutions will only be counted if they are delivered in the requested fashion, so make sure you post your contribution on time.
