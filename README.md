# Let's try to build our personal AI apps ** EXPERIMENT **

Welcome to **h3k.si** bounty page!

We are a group of developers and AI enthusiasts that want to build a better future by starting on ourselves.

We want to build personal analytics and AI tools for better living, by building applications, components, and algorithms of a higher specter of reusability. 
This way by building for ourselves, we build a dynamic structure that can be fit to many problems and eventually can evolve in self-learning application.

## We believe that graph is the future of AI and self-learning applications.

We propose starting with basic stack, that covers database, server(API) and client for displaying our results. => [Grandstack](https://grandstack.io/)
But we are not maried to it. If through our itearions we find a better basic approach, we will gladly change to that.

This way your solutions for the exercises are not required to be built solely on neo4j, graphql, apollo and react. 
What we want is for you to stick to our basic approach of graphs everywhere. This is why you will need to use graph database of some kind in your solutions. We use [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) 

## Use existing solutions (open source) and build on them.
We encourage you to use existing solutions (opensource) where you see fit, and build opon them. All we require is for you to guarantie that what you used is really opensource and free to incorporate in next projects.

## Have fun and learn from others
Although we call the bounties, the aim is to bring together a community of developers that want to learn fromone another. We will cover many aspects of whole development cycle and will not stick only to AI solutions.

We belive that in order to develop truly AI driven applications, the application itself needs to have backbone that accomodates this. This is why without a good arhitectural design of bottomline app we will not be able to build self evolvnig solutions.

This way AI delevelopers will be able to learn form frontend/backend javascript ninjas and a bit later those same indivit+duals will be able to broaden their knowledge with AI algorithms.

## Chalenge structure
Our challenges will be constructed on bi-weekly (later hopefully weekly) cycle. 
Each cycles goal will be posted as new folder on this repository, where you will find the scope, all information is needed for participation and due date for deliverables.

Bounty eligible solutions will be only the ones delivered in requested fashion till exact due date given by the scope.
