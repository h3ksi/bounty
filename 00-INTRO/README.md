# Basic information for participation

## Teams
Teams can be of any desired size, level of knowledge and overall experience, as long as they are driven and excited to participate. They can be modified and changed from one challenge to another, so if you have a friend that you want to incorporate for specific challenge, you are free to do so. Main thing the teams need to assure, is that all given code and committed solutions are open source.

## Rewards
Rewards are set at 500â‚¬ per cycle but because challenges will vary in difficulty these rewards are not set in stone. If the size of the reward changes, all teams will be notified before the challenge begins

## Evaluation
Solutions for challenges will be peer reviewed with the best solution taking the entire reward. Decisions will be based on architectural design and how multiusefull the solution is.

## Environment
All demos of solutions need to be delivered on Hekovnik's kubernetes platform (k8.si) and shared on open repository. Without this deliverable, your solution is not valid for bounty.

If you wish to get access to k8.si and get your own namespace for delivering a solution: apply [here](https://vision.h3k.si/k8si-access). You will be granted access in 24h so make sure you calculate some extra time to test your solution. If you are unable to see the form for registration, email us at agi@hekovnik.si with you first and last name and we will provide you the required access.

**Please be diligent, If you wish to compete in a bounty, don't fill out the form for Kubernetes on the last day!**

We are providing you with our local machinery on which we have build our kubernetes cluster, so not all things are out of the box for usability yet. This is why we kindly ask you to always equip your solutions with <teamName>.<solutionName>.k8.si when preparing your .yaml files.

## How2
For those of you that haven't used or deployed to kubernetes before, you can find simple how2 in this folder to see grandstack starter as demo deployed to kubernetes.
