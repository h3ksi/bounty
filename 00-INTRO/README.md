# Basic information for participation

## Teams
You can have a team of desired size, knowledge, and overall experience. You can modify your team during the challenges. You only need to assure all given code/solutions are open source.

## Rewards
Rewards are decided on 500â‚¬ per cycle, if the size of an reward changes all teams will be notified before the challenge itself.

## Evaluation
Solutions for challenges will be peer reviewed and decided on best one. Decissions will be based on architectural design and how multiusefull solution is.

## Environment
All demos of solutions need to be delivered on Hekovnik's kubernetes platform (k8.si) and shared on open repository. Without this deliverable your solution is not valid for bounty.

If you wish to get access to k8.si and get you rown namespace for delivering a solution: apply [here](https://vision.h3k.si/k8si-access). you will get your access in 24h and will be able to test your solution.

**Please if you wish to compete in a bounty, do not fill out this form on your last day for deliverable!**

We are providing you with our local machinery on which we have build our kbernetes cluster, so not all things are out of the box for usability jet. This is why we kindly ask you to always equip your solutions with <teamName>.<solutionName>.k8.si when preparing your .yaml files.
